Kudos to Kyle Hall at:

for his KohaTools. We dervied the code that produces PDF notices from his
overdue notice code. Check out all his projects! They rock and could be 
useful to you!

Kudos also to DtTvB for his authorship of his awsome date selector!

It is *very* important you follow all instructions carefully 

1. Install apache with PHP and also optionally install MySQL (XAMPP is easy)
  * If the optional MySQL database is installed then upload kohaextras.sql into the database manually
  * Copy the kohatools directory to your web server folder (htdocs in XAMPP)

1.1. Install these PHP-Pear Modules the proper way for your distribution.
	a)	Pear-DB
	b)	Pear-Marc
	c)	Pear-Linked-List

2. go to file addrkoha.php, change ALL parameters as needed 
  * 

2.5 Did you do #2? 

3. navigate to http://127.0.0.1/kohaextras/reports.htm to test the install
   or navigate to http://yourserverip/kohaextras/reports.htm

4. Make a link in Koha to http://127.0.0.1/kohaextras/reports.htm. Kohaextras links
   back into Koha easily since Koha is web based which allows flexibility. 

5. if it doesn't work, check all steps again!

Optional but a good idea:
You probably want to setup an .htaccess somewhere in the kohaextras directory so you have some 
security for authorized uses. 

Future of Koha Extras:
* Improve the security.
* Add branch code to all tools, which should not be too hard, as the routines already exist.
* Migrate some of the tools or features into existing Koha release.
